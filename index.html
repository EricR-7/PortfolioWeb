            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Eric, a hobbyist who's very much interested in how things work with technology. 
                I have a passion for creating wacky software/hardware projects.
            <br>
            I am a beginner, keen to learn more about web design and programming.</p>

                <h3>This portfolio</h3>
                <p>This portfolio website. This project involves with HTML and CSS. Soon to learn, Javascript!</p>

                <h3>Scripted questions and responses</h3>
                <p>This project is a simple script where the computer asks for the users; name, age and gender; 
                    Gives a response with those variables uniquely on the terminal. This project was written in C.</p>

                <h3>Self watering plant</h3>
                <p>This project was for Harvard's CS50x online course, the device would check if the soil is dry then will pump water to the plant and will stop until the soil is moist.<br>
                    It repeats itself endlessly... until the battery dies! This project was written in C++ with an arduino, pump and a breadboard.</p>
